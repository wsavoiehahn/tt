        "How can I find my Sendero Health Plan Member ID Card?":"You should have received an email with your digital ID cards on Dec. 24 or 26, 2024. If you missed it or need to find your card, visit the Member ID Lookup (https://senderohealth002.my.site.com/getMyIdCard/s/) page. You will be asked for the policyholder's name, date of birth, and social security number, as well as the email address used for enrollment.",
        "How do I get into the Member Portal?": "Using your Member ID number, you can sign up for our Sendero Member Portal (https://senmember.eixsys.com/Identity/Account/Login) to access your ID cards, track your claims, view your explanation of benefits (EOB), change your primary care provider, and more. To register, enter your 11-digit Member ID exactly as it appears on your card, with nine digits followed by a dash and the last two digits. Example: 123456789-01. For step-by-step instructions, use our Member Portal Access Guide in English (https://senderohealth.com/files/2025/Sendero%20Member%20Portal%20User%20Guide%20(ENGLISH).pdf) or Spanish (https://senderohealth.com/files/2025/Sendero%20Member%20Portal%20User%20Guide%20(SPANISH).pdf).",
        "What if the Primary Care Provider (PCP) on my Member ID card is wrong?":"You can visit any in-network provider outlined in your plan, regardless of the PCP listed on your card. You do not need to wait for an updated ID card to access your health plan benefits. If you did not select a PCP during enrollment, one is automatically assigned to you and will be listed on your digital and physical Member ID cards. If you would like to update or change the PCP listed on your card, you can do so in the Sendero Member Portal (https://members.senderohealth.com/). Please note it will take approximately one business day for updates to be reflected in the portal.",
        "Where can I find information about my health plan?":"Important details such as phone numbers, a glossary, and more can be found on the Members (https://senderohealth.com/members/) page on our website.",
        "I submitted a payment, why was I still billed?":"Invoices are automatically generated, so they can sometimes get mailed before we process your payment.",
        "What if I have an urgent request?":"If you do not have your ID number and have an appointment or need to pick up medications in the next 24-48 hours, email us at CustomerSupport@senderohealth.com. Use the word 'URGENT' in the subject line, and include your name, phone number, and any details related to your question(s), such as the name of the provider or pharmacy. Please only use 'URGENT' for doctor visits or medications needed in 24-48 hours.",
        "I need to see a doctor quickly, where can I go?": "All Sendero Health Plans include 24/7 Virtual Urgent Care through NormanMD (https://senderohealth.com/normanmd/) at no extra cost. Register and connect directly with a Doctor in less than 5 minutes.",
        "How can I contact Sendero if I have more questions?":"Due to the exceptionally high call volume, wait times are longer than usual to speak with a member services representative. If you need to find your digital ID card or register for the member portal, please see the instructions above. If you have a question not related to those topics, please email us at CustomerSupport@senderohealth.com and we will do our best to get back to you promptly."

      "welcome_message": "Thank you for calling Sendero Health Plans. Due to an extremely high number of calls, hold times and call-back times are longer than usual. If you need your Member ID Card or Member Portal instructions, visit our Member FAQs page at senderohealth.com/member-faqs/. If the PCP on your ID card is wrong, you can still see any in-network provider, you do not need to speak with a representative. If you have a doctor's  appointment or need to pick up medications in the next 24-48 hours, email us at CustomerSupport@senderohealth.com. Include URGENT in the subject line, and include your name, phone number, and any details related to your question(s), such as the name of the provider or pharmacy. Being respectful of members with truly URGENT Issues, we request that you not use URGENT in the subject line for anything other than doctor visits or medications needed in 24-48 hours. We appreciate your patience as we respond to each call, email and message."
